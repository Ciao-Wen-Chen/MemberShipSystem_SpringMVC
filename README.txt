This is the READ ME file about the code of the 2681496C MSc project:

The codes can be separated into three parts:

1. The pre-processing of the training data and the model training.

We developed this part with the React.js framework, in this part, we used some components from Bootstrap, https://mui.com/. And we also refer to some tutorials on the YouTube. We list them here:
